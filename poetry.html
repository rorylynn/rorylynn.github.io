        <h2>October</h2>
        <p>
            Plum colored hands shudder and whine 
        </p>   
        <p>
             Raw from hollowing out a space
        </p>      
        <p>
             In the snow 
        </p> 
        <hr>

        </hr>     
        <p>
            Stomach vibrating inside
        </p>   
        <p>
            Clawing its’ way up my throat
        </p>  
        <p>
            I swallow it back down 
        </p>  
        <hr>
             
        </hr>
        <p>
            A crow crawls in stained snowflakes
        </p>
        <p>
             Its leg contorted inward
        </p>
        <p>
            The sun sets and watches it die

        <h2>A Light On</h2>
        <p>
                Theirs a light on in the building down the street
        </p>
        <p>       
                The sun is missed
        </p>
        <hr>
        </hr>
        <p>
                There’s a light on in my bathroom
        </p>
        <p>
                The floor is cold
        </p>

        <h2>Rot</h2>
        <p>
                I lie in bed, watching car lights reflect on the wall. Wallowing in the depths of my sadness. I begin to scratch at my scalp, trying to rid my brain of it. I pick and pick, until a chunk of brain falls out, landing bloody on the white sheets. I continue to pull my brain apart, using both hands. Strings of red-stained blonde hair and skull fragments cling to my nails. The desperation to be free takes hold of me. Soon there will be no brain left. No world. Peace.

        <h2>Solitude</h2>
        <p>
            Winter trees
        </p>
        <p>
            Alone in the forest
        </p>
        <p>
             Still hands
        </p>
        <hr>

        </hr>
        <p>
            Trees, barren and frozen in mid-January. Snow piles up on brittle branches until they snap and collide with the ground. After the collision, there is silence once again. Dragging deep into the woods, cushioned in the snow lies a pair of  wrinkled, worker’s hands, connected to the body of a man, whose last crooked smile is pressed into the snow. He is slowly covered by mounds of snow, blending into the earth.

        <h2>Haiku</h2>
        <p>
            The bird fails to fly
        </p>
        <p>
            Singing to the air,
        </p>
        <p>
            The man trudges along.

        <h2>There</h2>
        <p>
             The streetlights turn everything yellow and I am alone.
        </p>
        <p>
             Everyone I pass is faceless and barely there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their skin is flat and one-dimensional
        </p>
        <p>
            They never had noses or mouths or eyes
        </p>
        <p>
             They’ve always been like this
        </p>
        <p>
             They walk by me
        </p>
        <p>
             Every day
        </p>
        <p>
             But the minute they pass
        </p>
        <P>
             I forget they were ever there
        </P>
        <p>
             I think they never were
        </p>
        <hr>
        </hr>
        <p>
             I see myself in the window of a hair salon
        </p>
        <p>
             But when I look again,
        </p>
        <P>
             I’m not there.
        </P>
        <p>
             I think I never was. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        </hr>
        <p>
             Everything is blurred and the streetlights
        </p>
        <p>
              Stretch themselves inside the concrete,
        </p>
        <p>
             Disappearing underneath me.
        </p>
        <p>
             Everything is still yellow.
        </p>
        <hr>
        </hr>
        <p>
             There is a thumping underneath the street.
        </p>
        <p>
             It gets louder as I lean down, 
        </p>
        <p>
             But when my ear touches the ground
        </p>
        <p>
             There is nothing there.
        </p>
        <p>
             It starts up again when I rise
        </p>
        <p>
             I can never catch it.
