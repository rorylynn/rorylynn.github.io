        <h2>Poetry, Music, and Fashion</h2>
        <p>
           Hi I'm Rory! I'm a writer and a journalist. I am a journalism major at The New School. I devote most of my writing to the arts. As a journalist I prefer to write entertainment pieces, specifically about music and fashion.
        </p> 
        <p>
            When it comes to poetry, I like to write about my own experiences. My poetry is inspired by poets like Anne Carson and Walt Whitman. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This zine will consist of my favorite work that I have wrote as well as work that other people have written. Each piece will either be a poem, a short story, or a journalistic piece on music or fashion. Work from others will largely be my favorite poems from other poets. These are poems that I connect to and inspire my work.
